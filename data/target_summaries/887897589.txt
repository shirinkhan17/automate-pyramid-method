Matter is the stuff all objects, and substances in the universe are made of. All matter can be detected because it take up space which is known as volume and contains certain amount of material which is known as mass. We can classify matter with our five senses. All matter has both physical, and chemical properties. Physical properties can change shape and size. Chemical properties change by producing new substances. All matter has energy. Energy can not be created or destroyed. Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion known as kinetic energy, and position known as potential energy.
