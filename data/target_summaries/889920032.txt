Matter is something that occupies space. All matter has mass therefore matter can be detected and measured. Properties help to identify and classify matter. One example of a property is energy, all matter contains energy. There are many forms of energy, it can be transferred from one object or system to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. Another property of matter is physical and chemical. A physical properties are those that can be observed without changing the make-up, or identity of the matter. Chemical properties describe matter based on its ability to change into a new kind of matter with different properties. So the difference between physical and chemical changes is that physical can be reversible and chemical cannot. One form of energy is mechanical energy which is the energy an object has because of its motion or position.
