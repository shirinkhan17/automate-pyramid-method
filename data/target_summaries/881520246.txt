Matter is 'stuff' that all substances in the universe is made. It's everywhere. Since matter takes up space and takes up a certain amount of it, all matter can be detected and measured the way you classify these is by their physical properties things like is it a solid, liquid or gas, how much it weighs, basically the makeup. Energy is closely related to matter because it's a property of matter.  The law of energy is that it cannot be created nor destroyed, it simply transferred. Matter can undergo either physical or chemical change. A physical change is changing like size and shape without changing the chemical properties but a chemical is exactly their changing. The chemical properties like burning paper mechanical energy is energy by an object created by its position or motion.
