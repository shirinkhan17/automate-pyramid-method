Matter is the stuff that all objects in the world are made up of. You can be sure that everything in the world has matter. Even water which as no definite shape or a gas with no definite shape or volume has matter. Without matter, the world would literally fall apart matter is detected by both mass and volume. That is how you would know it is matter.
