Matter is the 'stuff' that all objects and substances are made of. All matter has volume and mass and can be found and measured. You can see, smell and feel some types of matter. For example, trees, rock, bicycles, air, smoke, etc. Characteristics changing in the objects help classify matter that is called properties. There is two types of properties, physical and chemical. The difference between the two is the change in the objects properties (chemical) and appearance (physical). Energy is also a property of matter and all matter has it.  The rule known as the law of conservation states that energy can be transferred to one object to another and cannot be created nor destroyed. Mechanical energy is energy an object has due to its position or motion. There's two types of mechanical energy. Kinetic energy is one and has energy because of an objects motion. Potential energy is the second and has energy because of an objects position or shape.
