  <line>Matter is what makes up all objects or substances and contains both volume and mass.  Some types of matter are easily observable with the senses but others are harder to identify without the assistance of a microscope.  To classify matter one must identify the physical and chemical properties.  The physical properties are those that can be observed without changing the matter itself.  Examples of physical property are malleability, boiling point, melting point, solubility, and others.  The chemical properties involve changing the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties.  Examples of this are rusting and flammability, because it systematically changes the matter itself.  The primary difference between a physical and chemical change is the changing of the substance into a new matter in a chemical change.  By changing the physical property of the substance, the matter itself does not change, but in a chemical change the substance itself becomes something new.</line>
  <line>All matter has energy, although it cannot be seen or touched.  The law of conservation of energy is the notion that energy can be transferred between objects but cannot be created or destroyed. Mechanical energy is a cause of the object's motion or position; broken down there are two different kinds of mechanical energy.   Kinetic energy is because of the object's motion and potential energy is because of the object's position.</line>
  <line>---</line>
  <line>The author of this passage titled 'What is Matter?' defines matter as the stuff that all objects and substances in the universe are made of. All matter has the ability to be detected and measured as it takes up space defined as volume and contains a certain amount of material defined as mass. Matter can either observed easily with an individual's senses, or in a more challenging capacity. Examples the text gives of types of matter that are easy to identify with sight and touch senses are: rocks, trees, bicycles, and different kinds of animals. Types of matter more challenging to observe are: dust mites and air. Dust mites are too small for the naked eye but can be found in furniture and rugs, and air although can't be seen the author argues it can be felt with help of the wind, bending the tree branches. </line>
  <line>Matter can be classified by two separate properties: physical and chemical. Physical properties can be observed without having to change the make-up, or identity of the matter. Matter has several different physical properties that are outlined in the article. Examples of physical properties are: density, ductility, malleability, boiling point, melting point, electrical conductivity, and solubility. The author references clay as an object that is malleable as it has the ability to take different forms by pressing or pounding on it. Chemical properties however, describe matter based on its ability to change into matter with different properties. Examples of chemical properties are flammability and rusting, as the object is no longer made of the same matter. The difference between physical and chemical change is that physical change only relates to the size and shape of the object, the matter the object is made up of remains the same. The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds, although the new paper size is now one third of the original and is shaped differently, it is still paper.  Unlike physical change, chemical change occurs when the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced. The author keeps the original type of matter: paper, and explains by applying fire to the paper and letting it burn, the ash, gas, and smoke you're left with is not paper any longer. </line>
  <line>In conclusion, the author explains that energy is related to matter as it is defined as a property of matter, and all matter has it. Although it can't be seen or touched like matter, energy is very essential. The law of conservation of energy is a rule associated with forms of energy. This law explains that energy comes several forms and cannot be created or destroyed. Energy can only be transferred from one object or system to another. Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position. The two kinds of mechanical energy are: kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it is moving. The author asserts a parallel between speed/mass and kinetic energy, the greater the speed and mass of an object, the greater the kinetic energy. Potential energy is energy an object has because of its position or shape. </line>

  <line>The passage, What is Matter, mainly focused on the topic of matter and its components. Matter is identified as being present everywhere and in all substances. What is unique is that individuals are able to observe certain forms of matter using their senses while other forms are not so easily observed. The latter requires the assistance of a specific instrument such as a microscope.  The passage further explained that matter can be broken down into physical properties and chemical properties. Physical properties can occur without changing the identity or nature of the matter. It is important to know that if the physical properties such as the size and shape of an object changes, the chemical properties does not change. However, chemical properties have the capability to change into a different matter containing different properties.</line>
  <line>---</line>
  <line>In What is Matter?, we learn the definition of matter, its properties, and how matter relates to energy. Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space (volume). We can detect matter because it does have mass and take up space. Common examples are solids like a bed and a bug, liquids like water and milk, and gas like air and smoke. Scientists classify matter based on its physical and chemical properties.</line>
  <line>A physical property is something we can observe without changing the essential, atomic identity of the matter. For example, its shape, size, malleability, and density are all properties we can observe without fundamentally changing the matter. However, a chemical property requires the observer to change the essential, atomic identity of the matter. For example, a chemical property of paper is flammability. When paper burns, the paper's atomic make-up is changed and it is no longer paper. A final property of matter is energy. Although you cannot see or touch energy, all matter has it. Energy is transferred between matter.</line>
  <line>---</line>
  <line>Matter is all the objects and substances that take up space around us. Matter can be detected and measured because it contains volume and mass. Trees, rocks, animals, dust mites and air are all considered examples of matter. Properties are used to help us identify matter. Physical and chemical properties are the two main types of properties used to classify matter. Physical properties are observed without changing the identity of the object. For example, clay can be molded into different shapes and sizes but the molding does not change the substances in clay. Chemical properties of matter are characterized by their ability to change into a new substance with different properties. For example, paper burning into ash and irons ability to rust. There is also a physical and chemical change that exists in matter. The difference between a physical and chemical change is that a chemical change will create a new substance while all the chemical properties in a physical change will not change.</line>
  <line>Another property of matter is energy. Energy is related to matter because all matter is made up of energy. The rule that governs energy is known as the law of conservation of energy. This rule indicates that energy cannot be destroyed when it moves from one object or system to another. An additional form of energy is mechanical energy. Mechanical energy is the energy of an object that results from its motion or position. Mechanical energy comes in two forms, kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy occurs when an object is moving. Potential energy results from an object's position or shape.</line>

  <line>Matter is what all objects and substances are made up of. It can be measured because all matter has mass and volume. There are different properties and chemical properties. These occur when there are changes. When there is a physical change, the object can change into a different form or shape and can change back, but a chemical change, the object can change but [illegible word] 17 was. All matter has energy. It has mechanical energy because the object has motion or of its position. The is the law of conservation of energy which states that energy can't be created or destroyed.</line>
