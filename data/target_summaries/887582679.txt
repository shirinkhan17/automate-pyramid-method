Matter is something that takes up space and is perceived by our universe. All matter can be detected and measure. Some can be seen or it can be difficult to seen, for example, cats, houses, flowers can be seen. It's difficult to see dust mites. There are 2 ways matter is classify one is physical property and the other chemical property. Physical property is when the object doesn't change but it may change the way it looks and it's still the same thing. Chemical property has the ability to change into a completely new matter with other properties. The difference between physical change and chemical change is that physical change the object has changed (appearance) but the properties keep being the same and in chemical change the original object has changed into a new kind. All matter has energy because it's a property of matter. Energy cannot be destroyed but it give energy to others. This is called the law of conservation of energy. Whenever an object is moving on if it has a position it's called mechanical energy. There are 2 types of mechanical energy; kinetic is when object is moving and potential is when the object has a position.
