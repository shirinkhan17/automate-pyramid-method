Everything is made of matter. Matter has volume and has mass. Some matter is visible and others are only visible with the use of a device such as the microscope. Matter is classified by properties. Physical properties can be seen. Chemical properties can be changed into a new kind with different properties. Change can occur in both physical and chemical properties. Physical change can be restored.  Chemica change creates a new substance/property. Energy is another property of matter. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed. Kinetic energy and potential energy are two types of mechanical energy.
