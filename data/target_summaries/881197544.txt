All living things, man-made, or from mother nature itself are made out of matter. Also, because matter takes up space and certain amount of material, it can be detected and measured. Volume is what matter takes up as space; mass is what certain amount of material the object has. Because a cork is hard, it will break when you break it, and clay will flatten when bended. But when you drop both in water, the cork will float, and the clay will sink. These characteristics determine the properties of matter. Physical properties are what the object looks like without changing anything about it. Chemical properties describe matter when it is changed with a different kind of property. Energy is the property of matter. Energy can be transferred to one object to another, energy cannot be created or destroyed, this rule is called the law of conservation of energy. When an object has a motion or position, it is called mechanical energy.  The energy an object has when it is moving is called kinetic energy. The energy an object has when it has a position or shape is called a potential energy.
