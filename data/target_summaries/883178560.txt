Matter are what all objects and substances are made up of. All matter has energy, volume and mass. In order to classify matter, we have have physical and chemical properties are the density, ductility, malleability, boilling point, melting point, electrical conductivity solubility, and I'm sure much more. Energy can be transferred from one object or system to another, but energy can't be created nor destroyed. Mechanical energy are kinetic energy and potential energy kinetic energy deals with the energy with object while its moving. Potential energy is the energy and object has because of its position or shape.
