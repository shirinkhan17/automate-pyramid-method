In this passage I learned about matter, properties of matter, physical and chemical changes, energy and forms of energy. I learned that matter is the 'stuff' that all objects and substances in the universe are made of. And because matter takes up space it can be detected and measure. Matter can be easily observed with our senses. I also learned that matter has both physical and chemical properties. Physical properties are those that can be observed without changing its identity. Unlike chemical properties its based on its ability to change into a new kind of matter with different properties. A physical change is a change in its shape or size and a chemical change is when your able to produce a new material with new properties. Energy is a property of matter and all matter has it. Energy comes in different forms mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position. There are two kinds of energy kinetic and potential energy. Kinetic energy is when an object is moving and potential energy is energy an object has because of its position or shape.
