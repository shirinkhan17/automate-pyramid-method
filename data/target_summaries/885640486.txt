Matter is every where the clothes I wear the food I eat, the air I breathe all matter. You are in contact with matter every nanosecond of your life. When you chop vegetables for a soup you put physical cough on the vegetables. After you eat those vegetables they are broken down chemically in your body to absorb all the vitamins and minerals. In those vitamins and minerals is energy that fuels your body and keeps you alive but that energy is not destroyed it is released as heat and used somewhere else. I am putting mechanical energy to work right now in writing this paper.
