Matter is what every thing is made of. All matter can be detected and measured because it takes up space (volume). Matter can be classified by there physical properties. The difference between physical properties and chemical properties is physical changes make it look different but it is still the same thing. Chemical changes the object in to something totally different. All matter has energy.  Energy can be neither created nor destroyed. Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its shape or position.
